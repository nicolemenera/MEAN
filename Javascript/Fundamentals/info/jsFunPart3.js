// Create a function that takes in one parameter called “name” and returns an object 
// that looks similar to the person object from JS Fundamentals Part II.
// Running this in your terminal as you create it can be super helpful since we aren’t 
// manipulating the DOM!

// The returned object should have a name property that is set to the value of the name 
// argument that was passed into the function. Each returned person object should also have
// the other properties from JS Fundamentals Part II:
// ***distance_traveled - set this initially as zero***say_name - should alert the object’s name property***

// say_something - have it accept a parameter. It should then say for example 
// “Jay says ‘I am cool’” if you pass ‘I am cool’ as an argument to this method.

// walk - have it alert for example “Jay is walking” and increase distance_traveled by 3 
// run - have it alert for example “Jay is running” and increase distance_traveled by 10 
// crawl - have it alert for example “Jay is crawling” and increase distance_traveled by 1

var personConstructor = {
  name: "Nikki",
  distance_traveled : 0,
  say_name : function(){
    console.log(person.name);
  },
  say_something : function(phrase){
    console.log(`${person.name} says: ${phrase}`);
  },
  walk : function(){
    console.log(`${person.name} is walking!`);
    person.distance_traveled += 3;
    return person;
  },
  run : function(){
    console.log(`${person.name} is running!`);
    person.distance_traveled += 10;
    return person;
  },
  crawling : function(){
    console.log(`${person.name} is crawling!`);
    person.distance_traveled += 1;
    return person;
  }
}


// Note that in all of the above examples “Jay” is the placeholder for the object’s 
// name property.

// Change the function name to “personConstructor”
// We just created a blueprint for creating person objects!

// If you have prior exposure to OOP, think about how this “constructor” function is 
// similar to “classes”.

// Now create a ninjaConstructor that can be used to create Ninjas that each has a 
// name, cohort, and belt-level. Give all of the Ninjas a “levelUp” method that 
// increases their belt-level (Have all ninjas start at a yellow-belt)

function ninjaConstructor(name, cohort){
  var ninja = {}
  var belts = ["yellow", "red", "black"]
  ninja.name = name;
  ninja.cohort = cohort;
  ninja.beltLevel = 0;
  ninja.LevelUp = function(){
    if(ninja.beltLevel < 2){
      ninja.beltLevel += 1;
      ninja.belt = belts[ninja.beltLevel];
    }
    return ninja
  }
  ninja.belt = belts[ninja.beltLevel];
  return ninja;
